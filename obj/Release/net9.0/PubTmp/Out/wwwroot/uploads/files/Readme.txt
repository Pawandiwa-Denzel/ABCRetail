Android Emulator Guide for Your Virtual Machine
Welcome! This guide explains how to use the Android emulators set up on your virtual machine for project development and testing. Please read these instructions carefully to ensure everything runs smoothly.

⚠️ Important: Read This First!
There are two different emulator systems installed on this VM (Standard Android Emulator and BlueStacks), but they cannot be used at the same time.

Rule #1: You must choose one emulator system to use per session.

Consequence: The moment you run the BlueStacks startup script, the standard Android Emulator script will stop working.

How to Fix: To use the standard Android Emulator after you have run BlueStacks, you must reboot the entire virtual machine.

Option 1: Standard Android Emulator (Recommended Method)
This method uses the official Android Studio emulator. For general development and coursework, this is the best choice.

Recommendation: Use the "Small Phone"
We have set up multiple virtual devices. The instance named "small phone" is the fastest and most stable option. We strongly recommend using it for all your work to avoid slow performance.

How to Start:
Locate the startup script provided for the "Android VM."

Follow the steps provided in the script's instructions to launch the emulator correctly.

Option 2: BlueStacks Emulator (Alternative Method)
BlueStacks is provided as an alternative in case you encounter compatibility issues with the standard emulator.

How to Start:
Run the dedicated startup script for BlueStacks.

Important Reminder:
If you choose to run BlueStacks, remember that you will need to reboot the VM before you can switch back to using the standard Android Emulator (Option 1).

Troubleshooting & Key Takeaways
Be Patient: Both of these emulator startup scripts are workarounds for running inside a VM. They may take a minute or two to start up completely. Give them time to load before deciding something is broken.

Reboot is Your Friend: If your standard emulator suddenly won't start, ask yourself: "Did I try running BlueStacks recently?" If yes, reboot the virtual machine.

Best Practice: Stick with Option 1 and the "small phone" instance for the smoothest experience.
